# Cryptocurrency and Traditional Market Interactions

This project explores the dynamic relationships between cryptocurrency prices and traditional financial indices. We employed advanced statistical methods and machine learning models to propose both short-term and long-term trading strategies that capitalize on market opportunities while minimizing risks.

## Key Analyses:
- **Regression Analysis:** Identified 27 statistically significant correlations between cryptocurrency returns and financial indices such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and USD_CNY exchange rates.
- **DCC GARCH Analysis:** Revealed persistent long-term correlations between cryptocurrencies and financial indices, showcasing volatility dynamics.
- **Cointegration Analysis:** Found long-term equilibrium relationships between cryptocurrency prices and indices like the S&P U.S. Treasury Bond Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average.
- **VAR Analysis:** Demonstrated short-term price dynamics among cryptocurrencies and financial indices, with significant positive and negative relationships.
- **LSTM Model:** Forecasted cryptocurrency prices with an acceptable error margin of 10% for BTC and ETH, providing insights into price predictions for trading strategies.

## Trading Strategies:
- **Short-Term Strategy:** Based on VAR analysis, trade BTC, ETH, and MKR during short-term price trends, with options for hedging risks.
- **Long-Term Convergence Strategy:** Utilize cointegration analysis to develop strategies by trading BTC, MKR, and financial indices, including hedging with options.

## Conclusion:
Our study provides insights into the intricate relationships between cryptocurrencies and traditional financial assets, offering robust trading strategies for investors. Further enhancements using deep learning models and real-time data could refine these strategies and improve predictive accuracy.
